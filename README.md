This is an AR weather app that could let users query current weather data of a city, with Gif animation and also let younger users view a low-poly 3D model to learn weather knowledge.
This app is being developed using Room database(SQLite) and Google ARCore.

這是我用Java撰寫的手機AR app,使用open weeather api 獲取當地的即時天氣資訊後，根據天氣顯示出對應的gif與資訊,並使用Google Arcore與手機相機展示對應的天氣3D模型。
